        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Web development involves creating and maintaining websites or web
            applications. It encompasses various aspects such as web design, coding,
            scripting, and database management. Front-end development focuses on
            user interface and experience, while back-end development deals with
            server-side logic and databases. Full-stack developers handle both
            front-end and back-end aspects.
        </p>
        <h2>What is HTML & CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating
            web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage using
            elements like headings, paragraphs, and images. CSS (Cascading Style
            Sheets) is used to style the appearance of HTML elements, defining
            colors, layouts, and fonts.
        </p>
        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web
            development. It enables interactive elements, dynamic content, and
            behavior on websites. JavaScript runs client-side in web browsers,
            allowing for enhanced user experiences such as animations, form
            validation, and asynchronous requests. It's also increasingly used for
            server-side development with Node.js.
        </p>
        <h2>What is SCSS?</h2>
        <p>
            SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a syntax extension for CSS that offers advanced
            features like variables, nesting, and mixins. It enhances readability
            and maintainability of stylesheets by allowing developers to write more
            concise and structured code. SCSS files are compiled into standard CSS
            for browser compatibility.
        </p>
        <h2>What is React.js?</h2>
        <p>
            React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by
            Facebook. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic UI
            components efficiently. React utilizes a virtual DOM for optimal
            performance, enabling the creation of reusable UI elements through a
            declarative and component-based approach.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Git & GitHub?</h2>
        <p>
            Git is a version control system that tracks changes in files for
            collaboration on software development projects. GitHub is a platform for
            hosting Git repositories online, facilitating collaboration among
            developers worldwide. It offers features like issue tracking, pull
            requests, and project management tools to streamline the development
            process.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Figma?</h2>
        <p>
            Figma is a collaborative interface design tool used by designers to
            create, prototype, and collaborate on digital designs in real-time. It
            allows teams to work together seamlessly on projects, providing features
            for design creation, prototyping, and sharing, all accessible through a
            web browser.
        </p>
        <h2>What is UI/UX design?</h2>
        <p>
            UI/UX design focuses on creating intuitive and visually appealing
            digital experiences. UI (User Interface) design emphasizes the look and
            feel, including elements like layout and typography, while UX (User
            Experience) design centers on enhancing usability and satisfaction
            through intuitive navigation and user-centric design principles.
